# ReactiveMarvel

This repository contains source code for *Reactive Marvel*, an iOS application that allows the user to interact with the Marvel API and is meant to be for educational purposes as I continue to explore RxSwift and MVVM.

**TO DO**:

- Refactor CharacterViewModel to use the `Driver` unit.
- Add live authentication (the user does not currently sign up by network request or a write to local data store)
- Add a Character Detail View that displays Comics associated with the Character.
- Oh so much more as I learn RxSwift...
